# Hospital model

## Description

Created a database model based for given requirements, did object-relational mapping using Hibernate and searched it using the JPQL:
```
1. Find the most frequently prescribed medications for a given illness, and order them in descending order
2. Find a manufacturer of the most prescribed medication with given name
3. Find a percentage of people diagnosed with COVID-19, which received antibiotics during their treatment
4. Find an average number of procedure licences grouped by specialization
5. Find a name of each procedure performed in the hospital, and order them by price in descending order
6. Find a department which had the most operations
7. Find an average number of procedure performed by doctor with given name, per week
```
